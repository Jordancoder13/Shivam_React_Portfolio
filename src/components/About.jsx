        Hello! I'm Shivam Tripathi, a passionate and skilled software developer with a strong focus on front-end development. I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly web applications using the MERN stack.  With a BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I have a solid technical foundation, complemented by practical experience in MERN Stack, Firebase, and various modern web development tools. I’ve successfully built and cloned several projects, including web apps like Tata Neu and Starbucks, showcasing my ability to bring designs to life with precision and creativity. I’ve also make the gif Search app using MERN Stack .I'm always eager to learn, and my commitment to staying updated with industry trends drives me to continuously improve my skills.
